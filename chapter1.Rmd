## Introduction to Open Data Science.


### My expectations for IODS

I am working on my research plan and I need to do some preliminary data exploration in the data from the Finnish National Election Studies. This course conveniently came up in WebOodi and seems to cover the tools I will need to start working with the data. I have had some previous experience with data science from a course that used Python,  but I didn’t complete the course because it moved so fast from the basics to things like machine learning that I couldn’t keep up. From what I can see so far, this course seems to have a more realistic scope for an introduction and R will probably be very useful for me.
